## Extracurriculars
1. **Competitive Programming** - USACO, Codeforces, Google Kickstart
2. **Capture the Flags** - Use https://ctftime.org to find competitions - PicoCTF is a highschool only CTF hosted by CMU
3. **Competitive Math** - AMC, ARML, AIME, USAMO, Math League, etc. 
4. **International Science and Engineerin Fair (ISEF)** - Science fair, super prestigious
5. **Open source contribution** - Super prestigious to commit on a large repository. I reccomend checking out GSoC or some other "open-source mentorship" program to help you begin. 
6. **Research** - Do research + get publications - will add a separate section for this
7. **Internships** - Intern at company - will add a separate section for this
## Academics
### Classwork
If your school offers any of the AP Computer Science courses, take it. I highly reccomend taking the most advanced math course you can. Email your counselors about dual enrollment possibilities. The earlier and more you take dual enrollment the faster you'll be able to go into the industry.
### College
I failed miserably at college admission so I can't really help you here. 
## Research
Research is a good way to boost your resume and give you some academic experience: <br>
There are usually two ways research is done: <br>
1. Summer Programs - Applying to certain summer programs will help you with your research and hopefully get you published
2. Working with Professors - Emailing professors you're interested in and working with them - Do your own research on how to do this
## Internships
## Summer Programs
### Preface
I didn't even know that these kinds of summer programs existed until my junior year, after the due dates. Even then, most of these were relatively hidden from me. The selectivity of these programs as well as the application process would've been great practice for my college applications. However, I was pretty scared of applying due to how selective they were. I decided to apply for some my senior year and got in. My advice would be to just apply.
