# Highschool CS Guide
## Extracurriculars

## Academics
I highly reccomend taking either of the AP Computer Science courses if it's offered at your school. If your school offers dual enrollment, take it. You will save money as well as improve your application and speed up your career. If you can't do this, there are tons of online programs offered by MIT, Harvard, etc. which you can use to learn.
