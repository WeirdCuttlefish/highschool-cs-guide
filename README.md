## Academics
### Classwork
If your school offers any of the AP Computer Science courses, take it. I highly reccomend taking the most advanced math course you can. Email your counselors about dual enrollment possibilities. The earlier and more you take dual enrollment the faster you'll be able to go into the industry.
### College
I don't feel qualified to help you here. I reccomend you do your research elsewhere.
